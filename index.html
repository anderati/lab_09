DONE:
1. Header: foto y titulo o/y slogan de la pagina (tu nombre o no)
2. Pequeño parrafo sobre ti (vale añadir extra texto Lorem Ipsum)
3. DIV 1: Imágenes de tus hobbies (no vale informatica): los tres principales. Probar también align-items (alineación vertical)
4. DIV2: los otros en otro div. En los otros no hace falta imágenes, con un texto es suficiente: maquetas de trenes, musica jazz, patinar, etc, … solo un texto centrado en un div. Poner al menos 5 divs en este grupo y probar el flex-wrap, justify-content, etc

                <p>
                When I was a teenager I remember reading the manuals and procedures at my mother’s work at Banco Central de Venezuela, and imagining how cool it would be to work in a place where everything is so clear and the information is at hand for people to do your job well. That was the first time I got hooked on the concepts of quality at work. It can make your life easier by empowering people with clear and accurate information, in order to train them, make their lives easier, and consequently support them to success.
                </p>
                <p>
                Quality is the area of Customer Service that I'm most passionate about, as I believe having a strong quality service is a fundamental pillar for an excellent customer experience and satisfaction, and hence a profitable relation as well as an impactful contribution.
                </p>
                <p>
                My previous experiences have allowed me to specialize in creating, documenting, understanding, and applying CS procedures, as well as to guide my teams to understand and proceed accordingly through constructive, consistent and positive coaching and feedback, I really like this part as a way not just to help them to improve their support but also as a way to motivate them by feeling good when the job is well done. I would love to have the opportunity to design, develop and implement other procedures that can help to improve the service.
                </p>
                <p>
                I take great pride in my self-motivation, curiosity, perseverance, critical thinking and empathy. One of my strengths is being able to identify people’s skills, strengths, and talents, and help them to apply it in their roles. I consider myself an agile and adaptable person with a focus on long-term career growth. 
                </p>
                <p>
                In the past I’ve found great satisfaction at work when people have come back telling me that my feedback suggestions bring them positive results after applying them.<br> 
                I’m open to work and dedicating this time in my ongoing self improvement as well as developing and learning more about quality strategies and data analysis, and development of leadership and coaching skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Ideally my next role would be in a Quality related department, I would consider taking on a customer-facing role if the company offers short-term internal career opportunities, as I understand that starting as an agent would still be beneficial to obtain first-hand experience of the company. 
                </p>
                <p>
                 Outside of work, one of the things I love is reading and learning about history, geography, politics, personal improvement, psychology and science. I’m a very social person who loves to engage in nice and interesting conversations anytime.
